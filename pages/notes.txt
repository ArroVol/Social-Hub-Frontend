//for server side rendering - next.js provides 2 solutions 
//(static site generation) - if we dont server side it will become static 
this means these are static assets that get cashed 
unlike a chat that needs to be server side rendered.
how to determine where we do what?
next.js takes care of this for us based on the functions we use.
get static props means the page is static, by default its static 
as soon as you use get server side props it will change the page to be rendered. it will rebuild the page on the server 
it will then deliver it to the client.
main benefit - you dotn need to wait for the assets, everything is populated for you.
